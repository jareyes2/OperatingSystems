Read Me:
	make file gives some warnings on c4 machines but not personal machines 
	if running on c4 just enter the command make twice and then run file
	ignore warnings
	
	To run file use ./memsim to run file 

Pass the following commands to run program
	./memsim <tracefile> <nframes> <lru|fifo|vms> <debug|quiet> 

ONLY RUN IN QUIET mode as debug gives many print statements
